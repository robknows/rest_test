Description: # Rest Test
        
        For lighweight testing of RESTful APIs. There is an example of what a
        rest_test looks like at test/test.py.
        
        # Usage
        
        Install with
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install git+git://github.com/robknows/rest_test.git#egg=rest_test
        ```
        
        Include in your file with
        
        ```python
        from rest_test import *
        ```
        
        Write a test like
        
        ```python
        @test
        def can_say_hello():
          res = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/hello")
          assert_that(res.status_code).is_equal_to(200) # Using the assertpy assertions library
          assert_that(res.json()).is_equal_to("hello")
        ```
        
        If you need to, write code to start and stop your server like
        
        ```python
        @setup
        def start_server():
            os.system("./run-my-server &")
        
        @teardown
        def stop_server():
            os.system("pkill -f \"run-my-server\"")
        ```
        
        Run all the tests in the file (each marked by `@test`) by adding the following to the end of the file
        
        ```python
        exit(main(locals()))
        ```
        
        Finally, run your the test suite you created with the above steps by running from the command line
        
        ```bash
        python3 my_tests.py
        ```
        
        The exit code will be the number of failed tests (i.e. exit code will be 0 if all tests pass)
        
        # Todo
        
        - Create @before_each, @after_each
        
        - Specify a particular test to run
        
        - Executable for running all (rest_test)s in a directory (like test/).
