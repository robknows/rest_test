Description: # Rest Test
        
        For lighweight testing of RESTful APIs. There is an example of what a
        rest_test looks like at test/test.py.
        
        # Usage
        
        Install with
        
        `pip3 install git+git://github.com/robknows/rest_test.git#egg=rest_test`
        
        Include in your file with
        
        `from rest_test import *`
        
        Write a test like
        
        ```
        @test
        def can_say_hello():
          res = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/hello")
          assert_that(res.status_code).is_equal_to(200)
          assert_that(res.json()).is_equal_to("hello")
        ```
        
        Run all the tests (marked by `@test`) in the file by adding the following to the end of the file
        
        ```
        main(locals(), start_server, stop_server)
        exit(0)
        ```
        
        Where `start_server` and `stop_server` are functions which start and stop the server, respectively.
        
        Finally, run your the test suite you created with the above steps by running from the command line
        
        `python3 my_tests.py r # 'r' if the test should (r)un the server itself using the provided functions`
        
        Or
        
        `python3 my_tests.py a # 'a' if the server is (a)lready running`
